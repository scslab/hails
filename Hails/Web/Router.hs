Conceptually, a route is function that, given an HTTP request, may return
an action (something that would return a response for the client if run).
Routes can be concatenated--where each route is evaluated until one
matches--and nested. Routes are expressed through the 'Routeable' type class.
'runRoute' transforms an instance of 'Routeable' to a function from 'Request'
to a monadic action (in the 'ResourceT' monad) that returns a
'Maybe' 'Response'. The return type was chosen to be monadic so routing
decisions can depend on side-effects (e.g. a random number or counter for A/B
testing, IP geolocation lookup etc').

'Routeable' types can be converted into a route function using 'runRoute'.
If the route is matched it returns a 'Response', otherwise 'Nothing'.

In general, 'Routeable's are data-dependant (on the 'Request'), but don't have
to be. For example, 'Application' is an instance of 'Routeable' that always
returns a 'Response':

@
  instance Routeable Application where
    runRoute app req = app req >>= return . Just
@

-}
class Routeable r where
  -- | Run a route
  runRoute :: r -> RouteHandler

-- | Converts any 'Routeable' into an 'Application' that can be passed
-- directly to a WAI server.
mkRouter :: Routeable r => r -> Application
mkRouter route conf lreq = do
  req <- liftLIO $ unlabel lreq
  let pi = pathInfo req
  mapp <- runRoute route pi conf lreq
  case mapp of
    Just resp -> return resp
    Nothing -> return notFound


instance Routeable Application where
  runRoute app _ conf req = fmap Just $ app conf req

instance Routeable Response where
  runRoute resp _ _ _ = return . Just $ resp

The 'RouteM' type is a basic instance of 'Routeable' that simply holds
the routing function and an arbitrary additional data parameter. In
most cases this paramter is simply '()', hence we have a synonym for
@'RouteM' '()'@ called 'Route'.  The power is derived from the
instances of 'Monad' and 'Monoid', which allow the simple construction
of complex routing rules using either lists ('Monoid') or do-notation.
Moreover, because of it's simple type, any 'Routeable' can be used as
a 'Route' (using 'routeAll' or by applying it to 'runRoute'), making
it possible to leverage the monadic or monoid syntax for any
'Routeable'.

Commonly, route functions that construct a 'Route' only inspect the 'Request'
and other parameters. For example, 'routeHost' looks at the hostname:

@
  routeHost :: Routeable r => S.ByteString -> r -> Route
  routeHost host route = Route func ()
    where func req = if host == serverName req
                       then runRoute route req
                       else return Nothing
@

However, because the result of a route is in the
'ResourceT' monad, routes have all the power of an 'Application' and can make
state-dependant decisions. For example, it is trivial to implement a route that
succeeds for every other request (perhaps for A/B testing):

@
  routeEveryOther :: (Routeable r1, Routeable r2)
                  => MVar Int -> r1 -> r2 -> Route
  routeEveryOther counter r1 r2 = Route func ()
    where func req = do
            i <- liftIO . modifyMVar $ \i ->
                    let i' = i+1
                    in return (i', i')
            if i `mod` 2 == 0
              then runRoute r1 req
              else runRoute r2 req

The most basic 'Routeable' types are 'Application' and 'Response'. Reaching
either of these types marks a termination in the routing lookup. This module
exposes a monadic type 'Route' which makes it easy to create routing logic
in a DSL-like fashion.

'Route's are concatenated using the '>>' operator (or using do-notation).
In the end, any 'Routeable', including a 'Route' is converted to an
'Application' and passed to the server using 'mkRouter':

@

  mainAction :: Application
  mainAction req = ...

  signinForm :: Application
  signinForm req = ...

  login :: Application
  login req = ...

  updateProfile :: Application
  updateProfile req = ...

  main :: IO ()
  main = runSettings defaultSettings $ mkRouter $ do
    routeTop mainAction
    routeName \"sessions\" $ do
      routeMethod GET signinForm
      routeMethod POST login
    routeMethod PUT $ routePattern \"users/:id\" updateProfile
    routeAll $ responseLBS status404 [] \"Are you in the right place?\"
